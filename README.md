# Satyapan (सत्यापन)

**Verify the instruction, not the pixels.**

When a bank pauses a large, unusual transfer, Satyapan helps the officer check the "official" voice note, video or
notice behind it against issuer rules and the bank's own records, with deepfake forensics as backup, so the customer
hears three reasons she can check herself before the money leaves.

## What is in this repository

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `MODELS.md` | Declaration of every pre-trained model and third-party API, with checkpoint state and licence |
| `datasets/` | The synthetic datasets and the rulebook, described below |
| `LICENSE` | GPL-3.0 |

## Datasets

Only synthetic and public data. No real bank, customer or platform data, and no personal data, appears anywhere.
No external dataset is downloaded or used.

| Dataset | Format | Provenance / consent | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `datasets/fixtures/scenarios.json` | Text, JSON | Synthetic demo scenarios written with AI (Claude). All names, phone numbers, account numbers, IFSC codes, summons and case numbers are invented. No real person, bank or official appears. | 17 scenarios |
| `datasets/fixtures/variants.json` | Text, JSON | Synthetic robustness corpus written with AI: Hinglish misspellings, Devanagari rewrites, WhatsApp-style mangling of the scenario texts, plus benign controls. Invented data only. | 73 texts |
| `datasets/mocks/` | Tabular JSON, Markdown | Synthetic stand-ins for bank systems (ledger, beneficiary name look-up, outbound message log, registered RM phones, suspect registry, ED summons look-up, campaign memory, bank policy). Each is labelled as a mock of the production system it represents. | 8 files, about 15 records |
| `datasets/rules/rulebook.yaml` | YAML | Issuer and regulator rules drafted with AI. Each rule cites a public primary source (RBI, ED, MHA and others) with a URL and a `verified` flag; an unverified rule is demoted to a soft signal. | 23 rules |

Each JSON fixture carries a `_note` field restating that its contents are invented.

## Responsible use

- Synthetic, clearly labelled data only. No real official's name or likeness.
- No automatic blocking: Satyapan advises and the bank officer decides. Releasing a held transfer needs a second person.
- No scores shown to the customer: she gets plain reasons she can check herself.
- Forensic signals only corroborate. A RED needs two independent checks, never one weak signal.
